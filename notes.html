            > Also Stand Up is pretty great ( when it is used in an edu-tainment format Eg: Vir Das ).

            > Phase Test on the 12th, feels like I haven't prepared for it - Physics aati hai, Chem thodi thodi, Math bilkul nahi.

        <p>
            > I usually avoid fiction, but I want to read Homer's Illiad because I find many ideological similarities between Achilles and me who wanted to fight in the Trojan war, to become immortal - in the sense that he should be remembered throughout time. He wanted to acheive greatness and even though he knew he would not come back from that war alive, He went for glory and died only for love - in essence not dying at all.

            > Ashneer Grover is a great guy, well formulated opinions and good at analysing people and businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            > As Ashneer says, Mental Health is a western construct that we as Indians have imported, There are obviously mental problems that people deal with but they dont just happen - they are either triggered by some event or are caused due to reccuring surpression over a long period of time. But the point is that one must and can overcome these by simply not giving them power by your belief system and understanding that there are reasons for the way you feel and you have power over them.

            > Success, to me is helping others and having freedom of time and I want a life where I work towards these goals with all my might, as controlling your time is the highest dividend that money pays.

        <p>
            > I believe in saving and investing because as Morgan Housel wrote - Wealth is what you don't see.
